# Enghical
An open-source cross-platform graphics engine.

Enghical is an open-source cross-platform (not you osx) graphics engine.

Currently no versions of OpenGL older than 4.5 are supported (4.5 will become unsupported once a specifc intel graphics driver supports 4.6) Older versions may work, however.

If you wish to report a bug or make a pull request, make sure you are using the latest version of the Enghical source code, and state if you are using OpenGL 4.5 or 4.6.

Enghical is structured as a Visual Studio project.

Created July 14th, 2018.
